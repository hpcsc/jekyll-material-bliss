I'm a Software Developer at ThoughtWorks with more than seven years of software development experience. Before joining ThoughtWorks, my primary experience was web and application development in .NET and front end technologies like Javascript, AngularJS, HTML5, etc. I have special interest in clean code, object oriented design, scalable software systems. During my free time, I like to read about different
approaches in designing/architecting large scale software solutions like
microservices, Domain Driven Design, Command Query Responsibility
Segregation/Event Sourcing, etc. My recent interest is in exploring
functional programming world with Haskell and F#
