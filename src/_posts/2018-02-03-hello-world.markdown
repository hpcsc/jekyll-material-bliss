It's my first time trying out static site generator like Jekyll. Long before this, I used to have a blog created using Orchard CMS but I couldn't keep up my writing habit and finally abandoned it after a few posts. Hopefully this time I will be able to write more often

Some of the topics that currently I'm interested in and may write about when I learn something new:

- Functional Programming (more specifically Haskell/F#)
- Docker/Kubernetes
